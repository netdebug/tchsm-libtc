# Threshold Cryptography C Library

This library implements the cryptographic algorithms of Victor Shoup's paper [Practical Threshold Signatures] in the C programming language. The objective of this library is to provide a set of primitives to work with.

Its dependencies are the [GMP library version 6] and the [Mhash Library]. For testing purposes it depends on [Check].
