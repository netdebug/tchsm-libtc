# Threshold Cryptography C Library

This library implements the cryptographic algorithms of Victor Shoup's paper "Practical Threshold Signatures" in the C programming language. Its dependencies are the GMP library version 6 (https://gmplib.org/), Mhash Library (http://mhash.sourceforge.net/). For testing purposes it depends on Check (http://check.sourceforge.net/) and Nettle (http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle/nettle.html).
